    <p >ln lndia, the number of vehicles is constanfly on the rise, while the
        availability of parking space in cities has not kept pace with the 
        increasing vehicle numbers, primarily due to the rapid growth in 
        population. Consequenfly, issues such as traffic congestion, 
        narrowed streets due to on-street parking, a mismatch between 
        parking supply and demand, and illegal parking have become all too 
        familiar in lndian cities. Parking space has become a scarce 
        commodity, and instead of simply increasing the number of available
        parking spaces, it is crucial to employ effective technology-based 
        solutions to optimize their utilization. Smart parking solutions, 
        utilizing sensors and software, can provade realtime information 
        on available parking spaces to both city officials and drivers. 
        Furthermore, leveraging emerging technologies can help optimize 
        parking prices. A low parking price may encourage more vehicles on 
        the road, leading to increased air and noise pollution, whereas too
        high prices may generate less revenue and less efectuve resource
        usage.Apart from the loss of revenue for operators, there is 
        economic downside to the business in vicinity, effect on government
         taxes, employment.At the same parking space area and costs also
         have a corelation to balance optimum usage and revenue. Therefore,
          setting the right price for parking based on demand and 
          optimizing occupancy is the best approach. The primary objective 
          of the solution should be to equip city administrators with an 
          effective parking management tool that can predict, manage, and 
          finance parking in cities. An app should be developed to allow 
          citizens to conveniently reserve pce king spots and make payments 
          based on dynamic pricing This not only saves citizens' time spent
           searching the parking but also reduces environmental degradation
            resulting from congestion caused by parking and provides a 
            sustainable source of revenue for the city administration. We 
            need an innovative, simple and widely coveraged parking needs
             in the city and also become most compliant for Traffic and
              mobility needs.</p>
